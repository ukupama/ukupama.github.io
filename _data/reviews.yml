  text: Ukupama has a great vibe, especially when there is live music. Puerto Villamil is a quiet town with not much going on at night, so i recommend spending your nights a Uku Pama, meeting both foreigners and locals.

  text: I dropped in because I had heard there would be live music, but the town's Christmas celebrations had taken over everything. Sat and chatted with the owner, William, who is a very interesting man who has some great dreams. The bar has beautiful decor and ambiance, but the most impressive was the drink I had called Passion Moon. I can say with no doubt, that it was the most delicious cocktail I have ever had!!! Do try it! But it's dangerous because it tastes so good, you'll have more than one for sure. Try this beautiful place. You won't be disappointed.
