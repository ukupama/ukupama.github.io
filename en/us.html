        Ukú Pamá was built with local wood, materials from the island, which had to be treated and dried for more than a year. The finest woods such as walnut and balsa cedrela, shells and wood introduced by the first settlers of the islands were used; timber trees that had been used along the boundaries of older properties.
<br>
UKU PAMA is a word from the BEMBA language of songs from African tribes, it means BE BRAVE.
    </p>
    <p>Its construction was planned from the purchase of trees for felling to the implementation of volcanic rocks, endemic plants of the area, recycling material and other elements. All of them come from the same island, thanks to which, we are the first establishment that has been able to have a construction in accordance with the regulations and policies of Galapagos that consist of reusing and recycling to the greatest possible degree.
        The rest of the materials were purchased on the island in order to contribute to the local economy, also using Galapagos labor.
        Everything we find in Ukú Pamá was designed and built by its owner, with the greatest care in every detail, all in order to make the experience of our clients unique and unforgettable.
        On the way to build a dream, we had to overcome many difficulties, always maintaining the conviction to achieve the goal of having a 100% handmade place, with the best service and thus being able to offer our clients a unique atmosphere of art, live music and local crafts
