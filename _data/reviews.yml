  text: We went every day during our stay on Isabela. We loved the relaxing music, the yummy caipirinhas and the wine. William is a super nice host and established a beautiful cozy lounge you should not miss. On one of our nights the island lost electricity. No panic with Willian, there was candlelight already and to ensure the music continued he quickly went home on his scooter to get his rechargeable Bluetooth speaker. Do go, you will love this place

  text: What a lovely bar lounge. William and Rachel fun a fabulous little bar. Completely built by themselves from scratch. Great drinks. They have not yet started on the snake but you are welcome to pick up some on the way. Very soon the restaurant will be open next door. He is very helpful and ask him for advise on tours, what to do yourself on the island and even if you want a massage.

  text: Uku-Pama has a great vibe, especially when there is live music. Puerto Villamil is a quiet town with not much going on at night, so I recommend spending your nights at Uku-Pama, meeting both foreigners and locals.

  text: I dropped in because I had heard there would be live music, but the town's Christmas celebrations had taken over everything. Sat and chatted with the owner, William, who is a very interesting man who has some great dreams. The bar has beautiful decor and ambiance, but the most impressive was the drink I had called Passion Moon. I can say with no doubt, that it was the most delicious cocktail I have ever had!!! Do try it! But it's dangerous because it tastes so good, you'll have more than one for sure. Try this beautiful place. You won't be disappointed.
